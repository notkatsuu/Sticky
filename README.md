## Overview
Sticky is a 2D platform game made by four college students as a project for our 2D game development subject. We went beyond and did more than we were asked to in order to learn as much as we could and to deliver something beautiful and taken care of. We hope you can enjoy grading this as much as we did creating it.

The "Delivery 01 - Platformer Game" project aims to develop a simple 2D platformer game using Unity. The game features a main character navigating through platforms, collecting coins to increase the score, and includes various gameplay elements and additional features for extra points.
